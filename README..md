## 🧠 What is an Embedded Database?

An **embedded database** runs within your application — it doesn't require a separate database server. It's ideal for small apps, local data storage, or offline use cases.

**Why SQLite?**

- No setup or installation required
- Stores data in a single `.db` file
- Great for local development or lightweight apps
